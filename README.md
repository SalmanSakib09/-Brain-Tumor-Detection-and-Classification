Brain tumors are one of the most critical medical conditions, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as MRI scans, require expert radiologists to interpret the images, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. With advancements in machine learning and deep learning, it is now possible to develop automated systems that can assist in the detection and classification of brain tumors with high accuracy. The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. This model aims to: a) Detect the presence of a brain tumor in an MRI scan b) Classify the type of brain tumor (e.g., benign or malignant) to assist in determining the appropriate treatment strategy.The dataset used for this project consists of MRI images of the brain, sourced from publicly available medical imaging repositories such as Kaggle or other medical research institutions. The dataset includes labeled images, indicating whether a tumor is present and, if so, the type of tumor.The model is trained using the preprocessed MRI images and their corresponding labels. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. During training, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly detect and classify brain tumors.This project showcases the potential of machine learning in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection and classification. The developed model can serve as a valuable tool for radiologists, providing a second opinion and aiding in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
